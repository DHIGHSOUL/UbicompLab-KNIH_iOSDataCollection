# How to use
## Purpose of the test
While the testing period, the following actions must be carry out.
#
#### 1. Collect sensor data
Data collection app will collect sensor data and health data.<br>
When you open the app, sensor data will automatically collected. All you have to do is **turn on the app.**<br>
Please get close your devices(iPhone, Watch) to you. Also you need to sleep with **strap on your wrist**, and **put your iPhone on the bed**<br>
However, if you close the app, sensor data will not be collected.<br>
**So never close the app after sign in correctly.**
#
#### 2. Collect health data
It’s really hard to collect health data automatically. Because many variables are exist like user interaction, Lifestyle, etc…<br>
So the health data will upload manually. But it’s not difficult. You can upload data with a button.<br>
Before saying about uploading health data, I'll talk to you about how to turn on your sleep tracking setting.<br>
If your setting is off, please turn it on because we can’t collect data if that setting is off.
